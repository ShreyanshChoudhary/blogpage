<p>Hey my name is Shruti Tiwari and I am a third year computer engineering disciple at GH Raisoni College of Engineering.
    I am an enthusiast learner and enjoy applying it to my current life situations.
    I have keen interest in working with data
    if you have data I would help you in excelling it with best outcomes and if you don't have data then I would be glad in creating it.
    I like innovations and looking forward to innovating new things . I strongly believe that there is a solution for everything and we can find it regardless of the efforts it requires.</p></div>
